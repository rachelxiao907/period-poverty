        Periods are the number one reason why girls miss school
      </h2>

      <p>
        In developing countries, girls miss about 5 days of school every month
        due to their period. Because of poor menstrual hygiene, women miss out
        on opportunities crucial to their growth. Young girls who do not receive
        an education are more likely to experience malnourishment, domestic
        violence, pregnancy complications, and child marriages. Periods are a
        natural thing, but it has such a huge negative impact on a girl's life.

        About
      </h2>

      <p>
        I'm Rachel Xiao and I wanted to bring focus to period poverty because it is unfair how women have to pay so much for period products for something so natural. I was frustrated by the luxury tax on female hygiene products, and I realized there are other people who are in need of those products since they can't afford it. People don't talk about periods a lot and there is a strange stigma around it, so I wanted to bring people's attention to the negative effects of poor menstrual hygiene among those in poverty. People don't realize how big of an impact that periods have on girls because people don't discuss periods even though menstrual hygiene is important and natural.
